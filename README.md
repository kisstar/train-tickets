## start

Runs the app in the development mode.

```bash
yarn start
```

And start the mock service.

```bash
yarn start:server
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## build

```bash
yarn build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
